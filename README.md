# Dynamic Analysis of a 3-DOF Space Manipulator
This repository containes the MATLAB codes of the project "Dynamic Analysis of a 3 DOF Space Manipulator." In this project, dynamic analysis has been done using both methods of Newton and Lagrange. The codes have been provided with appropriate comments so that any one can understand how they work.
